Bottom-of-the-Jar Spicy and Tangy Chicken Marinade
By Rachael Ray  •  January 18, 2017
Serves 4
Ingredients:
For the glaze:
•	3 to 4 tablespoons (the last of a jar) orange marmalade or cherry, apricot or plum preserves
•	1/4 cup boiling water
•	2 tablespoons honey
•	2 large cloves garlic, chopped
•	1-inch piece ginger, peeled and grated
•	3 tablespoons Tamari sauce
•	1 to 2 tablespoons Sriracha, for medium to spicy heat level
•	1 tablespoon vegetable or peanut oil
•	4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts or 8 thighs or 4 one-inch thick pork chops or 4 skinless filets of salmon or halibut
•	Salt and pepper
•	4 scallions, thinly sliced on a bias
Suggestion: Serve with roast broccolini or green beans and sweet or hot red peppers dressed with cooking spray, soy sauce, crushed garlic and toasted sesame oil, garnished with sesame seeds.
Preparation:
Add glaze ingredients to preserves jar and shake well.
Roast vegetables, if serving, in 425°F oven until brown at edges and tender-crisp, tossing occasionally. Top with sesame seeds.
Heat a large, nonstick skillet with oil, 1 turn of the pan, over medium-high to high heat. Add seasoned chicken, pork or fish. Chicken will cook 10-12 minutes, turning occasionally; pork, 8-10 minutes; salmon or halibut, 7-8 minutes.
Pour glaze into pan and turn protein of choice to coat. Allow glaze to thicken, 1-2 minutes. Serve topped with scallions and vegetables alongside.
