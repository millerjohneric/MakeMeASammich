# DRY SHAMPOO

DIY Wet/Dry Spray Shampoo for Light or Dark Hair
•	1 cup warm water
•	1/4 cup arrowroot or cornstarch
•	1/4 cup vodka, rubbing alcohol or witch hazel (what I use is from here)
•	Essential oils or a spritz of your favorite perfume to scent
What to do: Mix all ingredients in a small spray bottle and shake well. Shake before each use and spray on roots or oily parts of hair. Let dry and style as usual.


Dry Shampoo Ingredients
•	1/4 cup arrowroot powder or organic cornstarch OR 2 tablespoons arrowroot/cornstarch + 2 Tablespoons cocoa powder
•	5 drops of essential oil of choice (optional- I use lavender)
•	An old make-up brush to apply
Dry Shampoo Instructions
1.	Put the drops of essential oil into the arrowroot or cornstarch and mix with a spoon. Store the mix in a small jar or old powder container.
2.	Apply with an old make-up brush to the roots or oily parts of your hair. Applying with the brush is optional, but it removes the need to comb through as much and is better for styled hair. If you don’t use the brush, comb the powder through your hair and style as usual.
