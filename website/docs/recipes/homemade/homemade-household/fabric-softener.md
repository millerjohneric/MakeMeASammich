# FABRIC SOFTENER

Recipe #1: Vinegar & Baking Soda as Fabric Softener
Ingredients
6 cups vinegar
1 cup baking soda
15 drops essential oil (optional) — here is my favorite brand
Directions
Pour the vinegar into a large bowl. Add your essential oil, if using. I chose to use lavender since that seemed like a nice smelling fabric scent to me. Add your baking soda. When fizz has settled, pour into storage container of choice. Use up to 1 cup (depending on load size) per load. I poured mine right into the regular fabric softener location. Note: Prior to adding the baking soda, the oil sat on top of the vinegar. After pouring in the baking soda and letting it dissolve, the oil no longer sat at the top. Whalah! I had no issues with any oil spots on my clothes.
Cost
Vinegar: $0.66 (I buy my vinegar from Costco for cheap!)
Baking Soda: $0.50
Essential Oil: $1.01 (optional, and price will vary depending on oil and quality used)
Total Cost: $2.17
Without the essential oil, this recipe would be much cheaper. I got about 8 loads out of this recipe because I typically run larger loads and used closer to a cup per load. That’s $0.27 per load when using the essential oil.
Recipe #2: Hair Conditioner for Making Fabric Softener
Ingredients:
5 cups hot water
3 cups vinegar
1 cup hair conditioner
Directions:
Mix hot water and conditioner together in medium bowl. (The hot water helps smooth any clumps from the conditioner). Mix in vinegar and pour in container of choice. Use the same amount as you would a store bought softener and add to the regular softener spot in your washer or during the rinse cycle. Note: I used a regular cheapo conditioner from the dollar store. The higher quality conditioners won’t make any noticeable differences, so don’t waste your money!
Cost
Water: Free
Vinegar: $0.33
Conditioner: $0.71 (I bought a large size from Family Dollar for $2)
Total Cost: $1.04
This provides anywhere from 30-40 loads worth, depending on load size. That works out to be $0.03-$0.05per load. SUPER CHEAP.
