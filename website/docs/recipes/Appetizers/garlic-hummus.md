Tips
• Use the water from the Chick Peas (garbanzo beans) to thin down the mixture instead of plain water. It adds more flavor, however, includes added salt, so be careful.
• Use large quantities of: cumin, basil, onion powder and garlic powder, along with small amounts of: coriander, paprika, and oregano, and tiny bits of: cayenne pepper and thyme. Make sure spices are well-blended into the mixture.
• Once you have mastered plain Hummus, experiment with additional flavorings to liven things up!
• Be careful with the amount of tahini added. Tahini has a very distinct and strong flavor sometimes. (The difference is whether it was "shell on" or "shell off" before blended smooth.
