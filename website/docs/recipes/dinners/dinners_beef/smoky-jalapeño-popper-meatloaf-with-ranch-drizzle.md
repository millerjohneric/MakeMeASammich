# 🥣 Steps

**01** — Preheat oven to **375°F**. Line a loaf pan with parchment paper or grease well.  
**02** — In a large bowl, gently combine ground beef, ground pork, smoked paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, breadcrumbs, eggs, salt, and pepper. Avoid overmixing.  
**03** — In a separate bowl, mix cream cheese, cheddar, jalapeños, and bacon to create the filling.  
**04** — Press half the meat mixture into the loaf pan. Spread the jalapeño filling over it, then top with the remaining meat. Seal the edges.  
**05** — Bake for **45–55 minutes**, or until the internal temperature reaches **160°F**. Let rest for **10 minutes** before slicing.  
**06** — While resting, whisk together ranch dressing, sour cream, and optional lime juice. Drizzle over each slice before serving.
