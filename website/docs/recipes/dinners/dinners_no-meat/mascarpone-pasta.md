By Rachael Ray  •  May 10, 2017
Serves 4
Ingredients
•	3 ears fresh corn
•	3 tablespoons EVOO – Extra Virgin Olive Oil
•	2 jalapeño peppers, chopped
•	1 bunch spring onions or scallions, whites and light greens, thinly sliced
•	2 large cloves garlic, chopped or grated
•	Salt and pepper
•	2 pints yellow cherry tomatoes, halved
•	A handful small basil leaves, torn
•	1/2 cup mascarpone cheese
•	1 pound corn or semolina penne pasta
•	Juice of 1/2 lemon or lime
•	Grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
•	Chopped mint and parsley, to serve
Preparation
Bring 6 quarts of water to a boil for pasta.
Invert a small bowl in a large bowl and stand a corn cob on its end on the small bowl and scrape kernels from cob with a knife; repeat with remaining ears of corn.
Heat a large skillet with a lid over medium-high heat with EVOO, 3 turns of the pan. Add corn, jalapeño peppers, spring onions or scallions, garlic, salt and pepper, and sauté 3-4 minutes. Add tomatoes and basil, and cover pan. Cook 7-8 minutes to slump tomatoes, shaking pan occasionally.
While to tomatoes cook, cook pasta in liberally salted water 1 minute less than package directions. Reserve half a mug of pasta water then drain.
Stir mascarpone into the sauce then add pasta, cooking water and a couple of handfuls of grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese to the pan; toss to coat.
Serve pasta in shallow bowls topped with more cheese, mint and parsley.
