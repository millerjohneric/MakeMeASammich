# BEEF AND EGGPLANT RAGU WITH RIGATONI
Beef and Eggplant Ragu with Rigatoni
By Rachael Ray  •  January 5, 2017
Serves 4
Ingredients:
•	2 tablespoons olive oil
•	1 pound 80% lean ground beef
•	Salt and pepper
•	1 medium, firm eggplant (about 1 1/4 pounds), peeled and finely chopped
•	3 large cloves garlic, finely chopped
•	1 sprig fresh oregano, leaves stripped and finely chopped or 1 teaspoon (about 1/3 palmful) dried
•	1 1/2 teaspoons (a scant 1/2 palmful) fennel seeds
•	1 teaspoon (a scant 1/3 palmful) crushed red pepper
•	3 tablespoons tomato paste
•	About 1 cup red wine
•	1 cup chicken or beef stock
•	1 28-ounce can San Marzano tomatoes
•	1 pound large rigatoni
•	Olive oil, for drizzling and to serve
•	Grated ricotta salata or dollops of fresh ricotta, to mix in or freshly grated Pecorino Romano, to pass
Preparation:
Bring a large pot of water to a boil for the pasta.  
Preheat a large, nonstick or cast-iron skillet over medium-high to high heat with olive oil, two turns of the pan. Add the beef and cook, stirring occasionally, breaking up with a spoon until browned about 4 minutes; season with salt and pepper. Add the eggplant, garlic, oregano, fennel seeds and crushed red pepper, and cook, stirring often, until the eggplant is softened, 3-4 minutes. Add the tomato paste and stir until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the wine and stir until absorbed, about 3 minutes. Add the stock and the tomatoes and their juices, crushing the tomatoes with your hands as you add them into the pan. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer at a low bubble while cooking the pasta.  
Cook the pasta in boiling salted water to a little under al dente. Reserve a cup of cooking water before draining.  
Add the pasta to the ragu along with half the starchy water and toss until the pasta is al dente, about 1 minute. Season to taste, adding more starchy water if too dry.  
Top with a drizzle of olive oil and some cheese and serve from the skillet into shallow bowls.
