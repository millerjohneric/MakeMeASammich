# ROENA'S PASTA SALAD
	1 box rotini pasta
Boil pasta for the least amount of time that the pasta requires so that it stays firm.)
	1 lb. regular bacon (Fry bacon until crispy and then crumble.)
	2 c. shredded cheddar cheese
	¾ c. onion (Finely chopped.)
	2 c. broccoli (Chop into small florets.)
Combine the above ingredients.


DRESSING
	2 c. mayonnaise (Never use Miracle Whip.) 
	1 c. sugar
	3 tbsp. apple cider vinegar
Mix together well and pour over pasta mixture. Mix all ingredients together. You can eat the pasta salad right away although it’s better after it has been refrigerated for at least an hour or overnight. Mix before serving. 

Enjoy!
