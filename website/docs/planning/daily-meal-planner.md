# Daily Meal Planner

Welcome to the **Make Me A Sammich Daily Meal Planner**.  
This page helps you plan out what you’re eating today so you don’t stand in the kitchen staring into the fridge like it owes you money.

Planning meals ahead of time saves money, time, and prevents accidental cereal-for-dinner situations.
